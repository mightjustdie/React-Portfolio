      <p>
        I am a driven young Web Developer and Mechanic. I started working on computers at 8 years old,
         whem I tore apart my first laptop and put it back together. I started working on cars sometime during Highschool
         and have been doing it as a hobbie ever since. I am a hungry learner who wants to pick up knowledge as much as he possibly can.
